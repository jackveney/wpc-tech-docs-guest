# Turning the Sound System On

Follow the steps below to turn on the sound system.

---

## 1. Check Rack Power
 The rack is usually left on, but it sometimes gets turned off. There is a red switch marked “Power.” It will light up red when it is on. If the switch is off, switch it on. If it is on, you do not need to do anything.

## 2. Check Amplifier Power
  Turn on the amplifier on the sound system rack to get sound output in Mackey Hall from the microphones or computer. The amplifier is the third most bottom thing on the sound system rack. Press the power button on the bottom right of it. It will stay partway in and turn blue when on.
