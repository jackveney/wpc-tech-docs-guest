# Turning the Sound System On

## Introduction 
This guide provides step-by-step instructions to verify and ensure that the sound system is turned on. While the system is typically left in the "on" state, it is important to verify its current status to ensure proper functionality. By following the instructions below, you can confirm the power state of the sound system and make any necessary adjustments. When you are finished with the sound system, please leave it in the "on" state.

## Check Rack Power
The rack that houses the sound system is typically left on, but it's worth checking the power status. Locate the red switch on the rack labeled "Power." When the switch is on, it will light up red. If the switch is off, simply switch it on to power up the rack.

## Check Amplifier Power
To activate the sound output in Mackey Hall from the microphones or computer, you may need to turn on the amplifier located on the sound system rack. The amplifier is positioned as the third item from the bottom. Locate the power button on the bottom right of the amplifier and press it. The power button will partially depress and turn blue when the amplifier is successfully turned on.

Please ensure that both the rack power and the amplifier power are switched on to enable the functioning of the sound system. If they are already on, you can proceed with using the sound system without any further action.
