## Microphones
  Mackey hall has various microphones available for use. They are detailed below.

### Pulpit Microphone
  The pulpit microphone is designed to plug into the pulpit. There is a cable in the top corner that it plugs into, and then that cable plugs into one of the two ports on the wall under the projector screen. This microphone usually resides in the sound system rack drawer.

### Plug-in Mircophones
  There are three other plug-in microphones. Two of them are specialty designed for instruments, and the third is a regular microphone. The two music microphones are stored inside protective bags. There are various microphone cables to plug these into either stored near the sound system rack, plugged into the sound system, or near the piano/organ in Mackey Hall.

## Changing Audio Levels
  Move the slider to the level that you want it at. It's best to have some kind of noise in the microphone as you adjust them and start lower on the slider dial when adjusting.

## Muting / Unmuting
  To mute/unmute, click the mute button at the top of the sliders. Orange is muted, white is unmuted.
