## Import Note Regarding Wall Controls
 Please note that since the replacement of the projector a few years ago, the controls on the wall outside of the choir closet only operate the video switcher. The projector's power cannot be controlled using these wall controls. Instead, you will need to use the projector remote to turn the projector on or off.

## Projector Remote
 The projector remote is typically located in the second drawer from the bottom on the sound system rack. If it is not there, please check the computer desk outside the choir closet. There is a possibility that the remote is sitting on the desk underneath the protective cloth.
