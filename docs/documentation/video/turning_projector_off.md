## Import Note Regarding Wall Controls
 Please note that since the replacement of the projector a few years ago, the controls on the wall outside of the choir closet only operate the video switcher. The projector's power cannot be controlled using these wall controls. Instead, you will need to use the projector remote to turn the projector on or off.

## Projector Remote
 The projector remote is typically located in the second drawer from the bottom on the sound system rack. If it is not there, please check the computer desk outside the choir closet. There is a possibility that the remote is sitting on the desk underneath the protective cloth.

## Power Off Projector
 To power off the projector, follow these steps:
 1. Position yourself somewhere near the projector.
 2. Point the remote somewhere near the projector.
 3. Press the remote's "Standby" button twice to power off the projector (see image below). This action will initiate the power-off sequence.
 4. Confirm that the blue light on the underside of the projector turns red, indicating that it is powered off.
 5. Once you have finished, please remember to return the remote to its original location.
