## Note Regarding Wall Controls
 Please note that since the replacement of the projector a few years ago, the controls on the wall outside of the choir closet only operate the video switcher.

## Connecting Devices
 To connect a device to the projector, follow these steps:

 1. Locate the ports next to the Scout Closet or the wall outside the sound system/chair closet.
 2. Each port is labeled for easy identification. When using the buttons on the wall to select the input source, they correspond to the labeled ports. This ensures that you can easily choose the correct input for your device.

## Switching Inputs
 To switch between projector inputs, follow these steps:

 1. Locate the button on the wall outside the sound system/chair closet. This button allows you to cycle through the available inputs.
 2. Each button corresponds to a specific input and is labeled according to the port's individual labeling.
 3. Press the button on the wall to select your desired input. This will switch the projector's input to the corresponding port you connected your device to.

## Input Methods
### HDMI Input
 Mackey Hall offers one HDMI input for connecting devices to the projector. The HDMI input, located alongside the VGA and RCA inputs underneath the input selector panel, allows for the transmission of both video and audio signals.

 To use the HDMI input, simply connect your device's HDMI cable to the corresponding HDMI port. This single cable will carry both high-quality video and audio signals to the projector system, providing a convenient and streamlined connection.

### VGA Inputs
 There are two VGA inputs in Mackey Hall:

 1. Laptop 1 (VGA) and its corresponding audio input port are located with the VGA and RCA inputs underneath the input selector panel.
 2. Laptop 2 (VGA) and its corresponding audio input port are located on the wall outside the Scout Closet, underneath the projector screen.

 To connect via VGA, you will need two separate cables: a VGA cable for video and a 3.5mm audio cable for audio. Connect both cables to enjoy synchronized audio and video. Alternatively, you can choose to connect only the VGA cable for video or only the audio cable for audio.

### RCA Input
 There is one RCA input in Mackey Hall. It is located with the HDMI and VGA inputs underneath the input selector panel. The RCA input allows you to transmit audio and video signals separately.

 Audio is transmitted through the white ("Left") and red ("Right") jacks, while video is transmitted through the yellow ("Video") port. You can choose to connect either the audio or video cables separately, depending on your needs.
