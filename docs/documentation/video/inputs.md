## 1. Connecting Devices
 To connect a device to the projector, use one of the ports located next to the Scout Closet or the wall outside the sound system / chair closet. All the ports are labelled, so when you use the buttons on the wall to select input, they correspond to the ports.

## 2. Switching Inputs
 Press the button on the wall outside the sound system / chair closet to select your desired input. They are all labelled according to the port's individual labelling.
